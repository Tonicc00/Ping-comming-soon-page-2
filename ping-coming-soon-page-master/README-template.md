This one was fairly easy. I struggled a bit wit the propper regex but 
eventualy I found it on the google. Started and finnished this project today and it took me about two hours to do it. I think it looks better than the previous one and I am proud of that.

With this project I think I learned to better arrange elements on the page with flexbox, but there aren't that many elements here so that may be the reason.
